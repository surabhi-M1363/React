Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for Drag and Drop Project. 
 
Level 0 (Context Diagram) 
At the highest level, we have just one process, which represents the system as a whole.

|  External Entities           |                          | 
|   - User                          |

Explanation: 
? External Entity (User): The User interacts with the Drag and Drop System. 
? Process (Drag and Drop System): The system processes the user's drag-and-drop actions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Level 1 DFD (Decomposition of Process) 
Now, let's break down the Login System process (Process 1.0) into more detailed steps. 
+---------------------------------+        
|      External Entity            |         
|         (User)                      |              
+---------------------------------+                        |                                              v                                +---------------------------------+       
 | Process: 1.1 - Drag Item | 
 +---------------------------------+       
               |                                             v                               +---------------------------------+        
 |    Process: 1.2 - Drop      | 
 |         Validation                |

|  Process: 1.3 - Update UI  | 
|  Reflect Position Change   | 
+-----------------------------------+ 
 
 
 
Explanation: 
1. Process 1.1 (Drag Item): The user selects and drags an item. 
 
2. Process 1.2 (Drop Validation ): The system checks if the drop is within a valid area. 
 
 
3. 3.Process 1.3 (Update UI): The frontend updates the new position visually. 
 
 
 
4. Data Flow 
? The User drags an item within the UI. 
? The frontend updates the position in real-time. 
? The frontend validates if the drop is within a valid area. 
? If valid, the new position is visually reflected in the UI. 
? CSS files handle the visual feedback of drag actions. 
 
Additional Notes: 
? Further enhancements can include real-time synchronization for multiple users.. 
? Security measures such as user permissions and restricted drop zones can be implemented. 
This structured DFD documentation provides a clear visualization of how data flows in the Drag and Drop Project.
