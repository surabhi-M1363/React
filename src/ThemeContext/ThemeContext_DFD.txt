Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for ThemeContext Project 
 
Level 0 (Context Diagram) 
At the highest level, we have just one process representing the system as a whole. 
 
+--------------------------------+ 
|    External Entities          |                  | 
|      - User                        |

|  ThemeContext System  | 
|  (Process 1.0)                 | 
+---------------------------------+ 
 
 
 
Explanation: 
• External Entity (User): Users interact with the system to toggle the theme and navigate pages. 
• Process (ThemeContext System): The system manages the theme and applies it dynamically across different pages. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Level 1 DFD (Decomposition of Process) 
 
Now, let's break down the ThemeContext System (Process 1.0) into more detailed steps. 
 
+-----------------------+ 
|    External Entity    | 
|        (User)        | 
+-----------------------+ 
          |           v 
+------------------------+ 
|  Process: 1.1 - Toggle Theme | 
|   (ThemeContext.js)         | 
+------------------------+ 
          | 
          v 
+------------------------+ 
|  Process: 1.2 - Apply Theme  | 
|   (ThemeProvider)           | 
+------------------------+ 
          | 
          v 
+------------------------+ 
|  Process: 1.3 - Render Pages | 
|   (About.js, Contact.js)     | 
+------------------------+ 
 
 
Explanation: 
1. Process 1.1 (Toggle Theme - ThemeContext.js): Users toggle between light and dark themes. 
2. Process 1.2 (Apply Theme - ThemeProvider): The theme is updated dynamically and applied to the entire application. 
3. Process 1.3 (Render Pages - About.js, Contact.js): The pages display content with the currently selected theme. 
 
Data Flow 
1. The user toggles the theme using ThemeContext.js. 
2. The ThemeProvider updates the UI based on the selected theme. 3. The About.js and Contact.js pages render with the applied theme. 
Additional Notes: 
• The system ensures that the theme persists across different pages. 
• The useContext Hook is used for managing the theme state efficiently. 
• Further enhancements can include saving user preferences in local storage for a persistent theme setting. 
 
 This DFD provides a structured visualization of data flow in the ThemeContext Project.
