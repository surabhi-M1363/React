Level 0 (Context Diagram) 
At the highest level, we have just one process, which represents the system as a whole.

Explanation: 
• External Entity (User/Admin): Users interact with the system by logging in, browsing, adding items to the cart, and making payments. Admins manage products and users. 
• Process (Ecommerce System): The system processes user actions, displays pages dynamically, and handles transactions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Level 1 DFD (Decomposition of Process) 
Now, let's break down the Ecommerce System (Process 1.0) into more detailed steps.

|    External Entity    |             |      External Entity           |

          |           v 
+--------------------------------------+ 
| Process: 1.7 – Payment        | |   (Payment.js)                        | 
+--------------------------------------+ 
 
 
 
 
Explanation: 
1. Process 1.1 (User Login - UserLogin.js):  Users authenticate and log in. 
2. Process 1.2 (Admin Login - AdminLogin.js): Admins authenticate and log in. 
 
3. Process 1.3 (User Panel - UserPanel.js): Users manage their profiles and actions. 
 
4. Process 1.4 (Admin Panel - AdminPanel.js): Admins manage products and users. 
5. Process 1.5 (Browse Products - EcommercePage.js): Users explore and select products. 
6. Process 1.6 (Add to Cart - Cart.js): Users add selected products to their cart. 
7. Process 1.7 (Payment - Payment.js): Users proceed with payments for their orders. 
Data Flow 
1. Users and admins log in through UserLogin.js and AdminLogin.js. 
2. Users navigate the EcommercePage.js to browse products. 
3. Users add items to their cart via Cart.js. 
4. Users make payments through Payment.js. 
5. Admins manage the system using AdminPanel.js. 
6. The UI updates dynamically based on user and admin interactions. 
Additional Notes: 
• Further enhancements can include real-time updates for cart and payment processing. 
• Security measures such as authentication and authorization can be implemented. 
• The system can be expanded to include order tracking, notifications, and reviews. 

This DFD provides a structured visualization of data flow in the Ecommerce Project.
